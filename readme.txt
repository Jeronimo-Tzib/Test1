This program creates an instance of the Binary class and inserts several values.

It tests all the tree operations with recursion as instructed:

    Inorder, preorder, postorder & levelorder traversals.
    Counting nodes and finding the tree height.
    Searching for existing and non-existing values.
    Deleting a node, followed by the reprinting of the tree to show change.

To compile and run this code we must:

    make sure we have the necessary files:
    
        binary.cpp
        binary.h
        main.cpp

To compile using a c++ compiler we could run as such in the terminal:

    g++ -o bst main.cpp binary.cpp

    and then run the executable:

    ./bst

Make sure you have minGW installed on your system, to make things easier
open the folder that contains our files and open it in a code editor such
as VScode. Then you can install an extension called 'Coderunner' and
we can simply click the run button on the top right and our code will
compile and run automatically.
